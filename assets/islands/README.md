# Island SVG Assets

Place your island SVG files in this directory with the following naming convention:

- `island1.svg`
- `island2.svg` 
- `island3.svg`
- `island4.svg`
- `island5.svg`

## How it works:

1. The game will automatically load all SVG files when starting
2. Each island on the map will randomly be assigned one of these SVG designs
3. If SVG files are missing or fail to load, islands will fallback to dark green circles
4. SVGs will be scaled to fit the island size (50-110 radius)

## File Requirements:

- **Format**: SVG files only
- **Naming**: Exactly `island1.svg` through `island5.svg` (case sensitive)
- **Size**: Any size (will be scaled automatically)
- **Design**: Should work well as circular/round island shapes

Add your SVG files here and refresh the game to see them appear!
